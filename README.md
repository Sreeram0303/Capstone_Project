# Capstone_Project
This system detects cotton leaf diseases using deep learning. Pipeline 1 uses EfficientNetV2, U-Net, and LIME for accurate classification, precise segmentation, and explainability. Pipeline 2 uses YOLOv11 and SAM for real-time detection and segmentation. Both provide disease type and infection severity.
